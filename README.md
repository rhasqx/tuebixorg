## Making changes

Most files can be edited directly. If you're making changes to the schedule,
please go inside the directory for the current year, manually edit `talks.json`
and run `../bin/update.sh` to update the schedule on the Website (Markdown files
in `talks/`) and Giggity (XML file `giggity.xml`).
Please include all relevant changes (at least three files) in your commit.
If you don't want to run the scripts you may also only change `talks.json` or
open an issue.

You can either open a pull request on GitHub or send patches (`git-send-email`)
to `info@tuebix.org`.
